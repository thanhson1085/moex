== Installation ==

1. Upload `captcha` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Plugin settings are located in 'Settings', 'Captcha'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to change captcha label =

Go to the Settings page and change value for the 'Label for CAPTCHA in form' field.

= During saving of settings I got an error: 'Please select one point in the blocks Arithmetic actions and Difficulty for CAPTCHA'. What is this? =

For correct work of Captcha plugin you need to choose at least one item from the 'Arithmetic actions' block and choose 'Difficulty' via Settings page, because math expression should be consisted minimum of 1 mathematical sign and parts of mathematical expression should be displayed like words or like numbers or both of them.

= Missing CAPTCHA on comment form? = 

You may have a theme that has not properly coded comments.php. 

The version of WP makes a difference...

(WP2 series) Your theme must have a `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` tag inside your `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php` file. 
Most WP2 themes already do. The best place to locate the tag is before the comment textarea, you may want to move it up if it is below the comment textarea.

(WP3 series) Since WP3 there is new function comment_form inside `/wp-includes/comment-template.php`. 
Your theme is probably not up to current code to call that function from inside comments.php.
WP3 theme does not need the `do_action('comment_form'`... code line inside `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`.
Instead, it uses a new function call inside comments.php: `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
If you have WP3 and still have captcha missing, make sure your theme has `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
inside `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`. (look inside the Twenty Ten theme's comments.php for proper example)

= How to use the other language files with the CAPTCHA? = 

Here is an example for German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to set the WP version to the required language and in configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` write `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in German.

2. Make sure that there are files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` in the plugin (the folder languages in the root of the plugin).

3. If there are no such files it will be necessary to copy other files from this folder (for example, for Russian or Italian language) and rename them (you should write `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in the both files).

4. The files are edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please load this program, install it, open the file with the help of this program (the required language file) and for each line in English you should write translation in German.

5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in the admin panel and on frontend.

= I would like to add Captcha to custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install Captcha plugin, activate it.
2. Open file with the form (where it is necessary to implement captcha).
3. Find the place where it is necessary to insert code to display captcha.
4. Insert lines to display captcha

`if( function_exists( 'cptch_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptch_display_captcha_custom() } ;`

If the form is html it will be necessary to insert the line with tags php

`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptch_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptch_display_captcha_custom(); } ?>`

5. It is necessary to add the lines in the function of check of the entered data (where it is checked what the user enters and if everything is correct the mail will be sent) 

`if( function_exists( 'cptch_check_custom_form' ) && cptch_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."`
or
`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptch_check_custom_form' ) && cptch_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA." ?>`
It is possible to enter this line in variable and display this variable in required place instead of `echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."`. If there is a variable (which is answered for the displaying of the errors) in the function of check so this phrase can be added to this variable. If the function returned true then you have entered captcha properly. In other cases the function will return false.
