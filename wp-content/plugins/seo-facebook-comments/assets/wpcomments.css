    This file is suposed to be embed only if the Admin wants to hide the default wordpress comment system

    In some cases when people create new templates for wordpress they might change some parts of it from
    the default theme that could case this CSS to not work.

    If thats the case you're going to need to find out the element ID or CLASS that is wrapping your comments.
    It will be something like this <div id="someid" > before the comments and a </div> at the end

    You can find that ID/CLASS using firebug with FIREFOX or CHROME DEVELOPER TOOLS or looking at the source code
    of the page (harder to find)

    More info on How to Do That
