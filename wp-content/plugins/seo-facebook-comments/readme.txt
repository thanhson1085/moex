This plugin will insert a Facebook Comment Form, Open Graph Tags and ALSO insert all Facebook Comments into your Wordpress Database for better SEO.


== Description ==


<strong>What This Plugin Does?</strong>

SEO Facebook Comments embeds a Facebook Comment Form on your blog and also looks at each of your blog posts searching for Facebook Comments already posted. All new found comments will be added to Wordpress Database.

Remember: <strong>You don't need to use any other Facebook Comment plugin</strong> with this one, SEO Facebook Comments will do all that is needed for you.

<strong> Why this is so Good </strong>

Among many advantages, you will have all your Wordpress Comments widgets and plugins still working since all the comments will also be at your database.

Also, even if Facebook goes down or slow it won' affect the loading of your site content.

<strong>And what is the SEO benefit?</strong>

Normally the Facebook comment system is embed into your page through an iframe. Because of that Google can't read those comments or associate then with your page.

This plugin changes all that by adding and loading all the comments on your page through your Wordpress Database like the rest of your site.

<strong>It will not hurt my server performance?</strong>

What makes this plugin shine is that it is very low server resources intensive. It will search for Facebook Comments specific to blog posts
only when those posts are loaded. This will save your server from any stress situation or overload.

<strong>One last thing... Incredible Easy to Install</strong>

All you need to do is enable the plugin, set its configuration with facebook (app id, secret and admin id) and it will already start adding all the facebook comments
to your Wordpress while the users visit your blog posts pages :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I setup a Facebook App =
Everything regarding this question can be found here
[How to Create a Facebook App](http://www.plulz.com/how-to-create-a-facebook-app "How to Create a Facebook App")

= How do I find my Facebook User ID =
Everything regarding this question can be found here
[How to Create a Facebook App](http://www.plulz.com/how-to-get-my-facebook-user-id "How to get my Facebook User ID")

= How do I find my Language Code to Configure the APP =

Here is a list with many available languages in Facebook
[Facebook Language Codes](http://www.plulz.com/facebook-language-codes)

= What the message " Warning: http://somelink is unreachable. " Means?
It mean's that Facebook can't find the page you're trying to use the SEO Facebook Comment. The reasons that could possibly lead to this are:
* You haven't correctly configured the APP ID or APP SECRET
* Facebook can't find the Host/Link of your page (using a LOCAL SERVER for example)
* You didn't correctly configured all the necessary options in the http://facebook.com/developers page

= It's normal that my comments appears only after some refreshes? =

Yes, in order to avoid excessive memory and server usage this plugins only updates the pages comments after someone loads that specific page.

So if someone update the page with a comment NOW and someone else opens that page the comment will not appear to that user yet. It will, however, appear normally on the Facebook comments box).

Loading a page will only make the Plugin sees that there is a new comment and that it should be added to the database, so in the next reload (2nd one) the comment will already appears at the page, if auto-approved or goes to the line of approval from the Admin.

= How SEO Facebook Comments keep track of the already added comments? =

The plugin uses a table that it creates (normally wp_comments_fbseo, depending on the prefix you used) to keep track of all the added comments and also the facebook users that added that comment.

= So what happens when I Remove this plugin and Reinstall it? =

On uninstall this plugin won't remove that table from database in order to avoid duplicating all the comments on a future re-install.

However you can access your database and manually remove the wp_comments_fbseo table, but keep in mind that it can cause you a lot of problems if you Reinstall this plugin later since it will duplicate all the Facebook Comments already added to your Wordpress Database.
