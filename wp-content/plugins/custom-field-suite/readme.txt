Add custom fields to the edit screens of your choosing.

== Description ==

Custom Field Suite (CFS) lets you add custom fields to the edit screens of your choosing. Each "field group" is contained within a meta box. Add as many field groups as you need!

= Features =
* Many field types: [Text](http://uproot.us/docs/text/), [Textarea](http://uproot.us/docs/textarea/), [WYSIWYG](http://uproot.us/docs/wysiwyg/), [Date](http://uproot.us/docs/date/), [Color](http://uproot.us/docs/color/), [Select](http://uproot.us/docs/select/), [File Upload](http://uproot.us/docs/file-upload/), [User](http://uproot.us/docs/user/), [Relationship](http://uproot.us/docs/relationship/), [Loop](http://uproot.us/docs/loop/) and more!
* The "Placement Rules" area lets you control where each field group appears
* Field validation
* Drag-and-drop field management
* Unlimited nesting for loop fields
* Easily customize where each field group appears

**CFS is a fork of Advanced Custom Fields v2.** The main goals of this plugin are stability, performance, and avoiding feature bloat.

= Why use Custom Field Suite? =
* CFS is super easy to use.
* CFS is stable. We test all changes before releasing a new version.
* CFS is fast and uses few server resources.
* CFS works well with [Gravity Forms](http://uproot.us/how-to-save-gravity-forms-data-into-custom-field-suite/) by saving Gravity Forms entries as post items.
* CFS supports [adding your own field types](http://uproot.us/docs/creating-custom-field-types/).
